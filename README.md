# Sorting Algorithms Implemented in Python

To practice Python programming, I implemented several sequential sorting algorithms:
- BubbleSort
- QuickSort
- QuickSort with an Insertion Sort optimization
- MergeSort
- RadixSort

The script `test_algorithms.py` provides unit tests for all implemented algorithms. 

The script  `eval_algorithms.py` measures the average performance of each algorithm and plots the results.
